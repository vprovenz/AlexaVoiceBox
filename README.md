## Alexa VoiceBox


Created for lumohacks mental health hackathon.

Uses an Amazon Echo Alexa to communicate with the user to play them encouraging and meaningful voice recordings sent to them by their friends and loved ones.

We created a new custom Alexa skill which communicated with an Amazon s3 server and would link to a React front-end webpage that allows friends and family to record thoughtful voice messages for a user.

VoiceBox addresses mental health issues in a preventative aspect, with a focus on motivation and social interaction, and aims to address issues commonly faced by those with depression and/or perhaps suicidal thoughts.
