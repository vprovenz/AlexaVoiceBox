## Alexa VoiceBox


Created for lumohacks mental health hackathon.

Uses an Amazon Echo Alexa to communicate with the user to play them encouraging and meaningful voice recordings sent to them by their friends and loved ones.

We created a new custom Alexa skill which communicated with an Amazon s3 server and which would eventually link to a React front-end webpage to have friends a family submit thoughtful messages for a user.

Addresses mental health in a preventative aspect, as well as motivational and social aspect, which aim to hit issues that can be dealt by those facing depression and/or perhaps suicidal thoughts.
